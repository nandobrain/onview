Oh the issues.

As always, I might have been a bit too ambitious and started building a page that was perhaps too big for me to finish on time. I originaly wanted to compile a page that included a gallery page, a bio page, an index page and potentially a calendar, but unfortunatly that was a bit ambitious and it distracted me from properly carrying out full crud on most of my features. Unfortunately this ment cutting out some of the fat and sticking to the index page and a single gallery page. 

Going forward, I would like to complete the app so that it includes a gallery page, an about page and a working calendar.
